## Inspiration
Did you know that the tragic Ghost Ship warehouse fire in 2016, which claimed 36 lives due to disorientation and inability to find exits, could have been prevented with improved navigation tools? This disaster, along with incidents like the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 and numerous other building fires, underscored the urgent need for reliable emergency navigation systems. These events motivated us to develop GuideGenie, an app designed to ensure safe evacuations and prevent panic. Research indicates that during emergencies, 75% of individuals fail to locate the nearest exit due to confusion and panic. Shockingly, in 2020 alone, over 3,000 people lost their lives in structure fires in the U.S. This alarming statistic was a driving force behind the creation of GuideGenie.

## What it does

GuideGenie is an indoor AR navigation app that provides step-by-step directions, even in low visibility conditions. It guides employees through complex buildings, helping them safely exit during emergencies.

## How we built it

We used advanced AR technology and indoor mapping to create GuideGenie. The app integrates with existing building layouts and emergency protocols to provide real-time, accurate navigation.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the main challenges was ensuring accurate navigation in various building layouts and under different emergency conditions. Integrating real-time updates and maintaining usability in high-stress situations were also significant hurdles.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We successfully developed an app that can potentially save lives by providing clear, reliable guidance during emergencies. The app's ability to function effectively in low visibility conditions is a major achievement.

## What we learned

We learned the importance of user-friendly design in high-stress situations and the technical complexities of indoor navigation. We also gained insights into emergency response protocols and how technology can enhance safety.

## What's next for GuideGenie

Next, we plan to expand GuideGenieâ€™s capabilities to include integration with building security systems and real-time updates from emergency services. We also aim to implement the app in various industries and continuously improve its accuracy and reliability.
